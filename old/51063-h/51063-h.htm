<h2><a name="IN_WASHINGTON_WITH_THE" id="IN_WASHINGTON_WITH_THE"></a>IN WASHINGTON WITH THE
SEVENTH.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">On</span> the evening of Saturday, April 13th,
1861, the intelligence reached New
York that Fort Sumter, in Charleston harbor,
had yielded to the rebel authorities,
after undergoing a bombardment of thirty-six
hours. It was felt by all that this act of
violence closed the door of reconciliation,
and dissipated every hope of a peaceful
solution for our political difficulties. Two
days afterward President Lincoln issued his
proclamation calling upon the states for
seventy-five thousand troops to reassert the
authority of the government, to "cause the
laws to be duly executed," and to "repossess
the forts, places, and property" which
had been seized from the Union. The first
object of importance was to secure the safety
of the national capital; and the President
had expressed a desire that one regiment
from New York, already organized and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
equipped, should be sent forward at once
for that purpose.</p>

<p>Learning that the Seventh regiment had
volunteered to meet this call, and that the
assistant surgeon then attached to it had resigned
the position, I applied to be taken in
his place, and had the gratification to receive
my appointment on Thursday the
18th. The regiment was under orders to
assemble and start for Washington on the
following day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile other states had also been
exerting themselves to forward any militia
regiments that could be had at short notice;
and, as usual, when called upon to act, Massachusetts
was the first in the field. Within
three days after the President's proclamation,
two regiments from that state, the Sixth and
the Eighth, were on the move. The Sixth
arrived in New York early on the morning
of April 18th, by the N. Y. &amp; New Haven
railroad. The terminus of this road was
then at Fourth Avenue and 27th Street,
where I saw the regiment disembark and
form in line, before proceeding on its march
through the city. Its ranks had evidently
been filled in some measure by new recruits,
whose outfit by no means corresponded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
altogether with the regimental uniform.
There were common overcoats and slouched
hats mingled with the rest. But they were
a solid and serviceable looking battalion;
and it was a common remark that in such
an emergency it was a good thing to see the
men in line with their muskets before their
uniforms were ready. This regiment was
followed by the Eighth Massachusetts,
which passed through the city twenty-four
hours later.</p>

<p>But at that time every one bound for
Washington was too busy with his own
affairs to pay much attention to the movements
of others; and the morning of the
19th was filled to the last moment with
indispensable preparations. Early in the
afternoon the Seventh regiment assembled
at its armory, which was then on the east
side of Third Avenue, between Sixth and
Seventh Streets. It had received within the
past few days some accessions in new recruits.
Its regular members reported for
duty in greater numbers than usual; and
when finally ready for departure it paraded
nearly a thousand muskets. From the
armory it was marched by companies to
Lafayette Place near by, where the line was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
formed and I took my place with the officers
of the regimental staff.</p>

<p>Up to this time our attention had not been
especially attracted to anything beyond our
own immediate duties; and for a novice like
myself they were occupation enough. There
had been visiting friends and leave-takers
at the armory, and in the adjoining streets
there was the usual crowd of idlers and
sight-seers about a militia parade. But
when the regiment wheeled into column,
and from the quiet enclosure of Lafayette
Place passed into Broadway, the spectacle
that met us was a revelation. From the
curbstone to the top story, every building
was packed with a dense mass of humanity.
Men, women, and children covered the sidewalks,
and occupied every window and balcony
on both sides, as far as the eye could
reach. The mass was alive all over with
waving flags and handkerchiefs, and the
cheers that came from it, right and left,
filled the air with a mingled chorus of tenor
and treble and falsetto voices. It was a
sudden and surprising demonstration, as unlooked
for as the transformation scene in a
theatre. But that was hardly the beginning
of it. Instead of spending itself in a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
outburst of welcome, it ran along with the
head of the column, was taken up at every
step by those in front, and only died away
in the rear. As the regiment moved on
past one street after another, it seemed as if
at every block the crowd grew denser and
the uproar more incessant. Along the entire
line of march, from Lafayette Place to
Cortlandt Street, there was not a rod of space
that was not thronged with spectators; and
all the while the same continuous cry, from
innumerable throats, kept up without a moment's
intermission, from beginning to end.</p>

<p>No one could witness such a scene without
being impressed by it. It was like the
act of a drama magnified in its proportions
a hundred fold, and with the added difference
of being a reality. The longer it continued,
the more it affected the senses and
the mind; until at last one almost felt as if
he were marching in a dream, half dazed by
the endless repetition of unaccustomed sights
and sounds.</p>

<p>Beside that, it gave us a different idea of
the city of New York. For most of us,
especially those of the younger generation,
it was mainly a city of immigration, offering
to all comers its varied opportunities for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
activity and enterprise. Hardly any one
gave a thought to its local traditions, or
believed in the existence of any unity of
sentiment among its inhabitants. But now,
all at once, it had risen up like an enormous
family, with a single impulse of spontaneous
enthusiasm, to declare that it valued loyalty
and patriotism more than commerce or
manufactures. The time and the occasion
had brought out its latent qualities, and had
given them an expression that no one could
misunderstand.</p>

<p>When we turned from Broadway into
Cortlandt Street the tumult partly subsided;
but after crossing the ferry to Jersey City it
began again. There were demonstrative
crowds in the railroad depot, and as the
train moved off they followed it with cheers
that were repeated at every station on the
route to Philadelphia. It did not take long
to discover that transportation by railroad
train, with a regiment of troops on board,
was by no means a luxurious mode of traveling.
With no seats to spare, many standing
in the aisles, and the remaining space
encumbered with arms and accoutrements,
there was little opportunity for ease or comfort;
and as for sleep, that was out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
question. Sometime after midnight we
reached Philadelphia, and were transferred
to the cars for Washington, at the depot of
the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore
railroad. But here our onward movement
ceased. The train rested stationary in the
depot. Expecting every moment the signal
for starting, we could only wait patiently
until it should come. Nevertheless the
night wore away, the gray dawn found us
still waiting, and no locomotive had even
been coupled on to the train. What could
be the cause of such delay, when everything
demanded promptitude and celerity? We
already knew that the Sixth Massachusetts,
the pioneer regiment in advance, had been
attacked the day before in the streets of
Baltimore, and had only forced its way
through the mob at the expense of fighting
and bloodshed. Was our own march to be
obstructed at the outset by a rebellious city,
standing like a fortress across the route?
Or were the railroad officials in sympathy
with secession, and purposely hampering our
movements by pretended friendship and
false excuses? The Eighth Massachusetts,
which had left New York some hours
before us, was also in the depot, on board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
another train, equally helpless with ourselves,
and apparently with as little prospect
of getting away. As daylight came, we
began to straggle out of the car-house and
up and down the streets of what was then
a rather desolate looking neighborhood.
The necessity of foraging for breakfast gave
us for a while some little diversion and
occupation; but that was soon over, and all
the forenoon our uneasiness was on the increase.
Who could tell what might be
happening even then at the national capital?
And thus far we had barely accomplished
one third of the distance from New York
to Washington. There were interviews
and consultations between the field officers
and the railroad authorities; and General
Benjamin F. Butler, who was in command
of both Massachusetts regiments, also appeared
upon the scene. But for the rest of
us there was little food for thought beyond
rumors, doubts, and surmises. So we kept
on rambling to and fro near the depot, and
wondering when this thing would come to
an end.</p>

<p>Toward noon some information began to
filter through from headquarters, and we came
to understand, more or less distinctly, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
was going on. In reality the state of affairs
was this. The railroad managers were as
anxious as ourselves to facilitate the transportation
of the regiment; but they had no
means of overcoming the difficulties of the
situation. The tracks through Baltimore
had been obstructed with barricades, so that
the cars could not pass. Even if these
should be cleared away, there was no certainty
that the company could retain control
of the depots and rolling stock on the other
side of the city. That would depend on
the coöperation of the police and perhaps of
the city militia, neither of which were felt
to be reliable. In fact, the Governor of
Maryland and the Mayor of Baltimore had
both sent despatches strongly objecting to
the further passage of troops through the
city in its present excited and disorderly
condition. Between the Maryland state
line and Baltimore there were two railroad
bridges, crossing the Little Gunpowder and
Bush rivers; and both these bridges had
been destroyed by secessionists during the
night. To repair them would need the
protection of an armed force, and would be
a matter of further uncertainty and delay.
The object of the regiment was to reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Washington at the earliest possible moment;
and for that purpose the route by Baltimore
was evidently impracticable.</p>

<p>The next accessible point was Annapolis
on the Chesapeake Bay, where the grounds
of the United States Naval Academy, located
at the harbor, offered an additional advantage.
It could be reached by either of two
ways. The Philadelphia, Wilmington and
Baltimore railroad runs direct from Philadelphia
to the mouth of the Susquehanna
river, at the head of Chesapeake Bay, where
at that time there was no bridge, the cars
being taken across on a steam ferry-boat,
the <i>Maryland</i>, from one side to the other.
The troops might be carried by rail to this
point; and then, taking possession of the
ferry-boat, might go down the bay, past the
harbor of Baltimore, to Annapolis. This
was the route selected by General Butler
for the Eighth Massachusetts. Our commanding
officer, on the other hand, Colonel
Lefferts, decided to charter at once a steamer
capable of taking the regiment from Philadelphia
round by sea to the capes of Virginia,
and so up Chesapeake Bay to Annapolis.</p>

<p>This was accordingly done. The regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
was paraded, marched down to the
pier, and embarked on the <i>Boston</i>, a freight
and passenger steamer formerly running
between Philadelphia and New York.
Her capacity was just sufficient to receive
so large a company with the necessary
supplies; and when all were on board there
was hardly more freedom of space than we
had found in the railroad cars. But no
more time was lost in waiting. That afternoon
carried us down the river; by sunset
we had entered Delaware Bay; and the
next morning, which was Sunday, the 21st,
we were fairly at sea, headed south for the
capes of Virginia.</p>

<p>All that day we ploughed on over a
smooth sea, with a fair wind, a bright sun
and a clear sky. The scene everywhere
was exhilarating; and the interest of the
expedition increased every hour with the
uncertainty of what lay before us. We
were approaching a region where all was on
the border line between loyalty and secession,
and which included the most important
military and naval positions in the
country,&mdash;Hampton Roads, Fortress Monroe,
and the Norfolk Navy Yard. Intelligence
from these points was eagerly looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
for, and early in the afternoon, when nearing
the capes, we came within hailing distance
of a schooner bound north under full
sail. The information she gave us was that
of the destruction of Norfolk Navy Yard
and its abandonment by the United States
authorities. This had been done the day
before by order of the navy department, to
prevent the ships and ordnance falling into
the hands of the rebels. It was the best
thing to do in the emergency. All the
ships left there had been scuttled, the guns
spiked and the buildings burned; and the
enemy in possession could not have made
anything serviceable for aggressive purposes
under at least a month. But we were ignorant
of these details. We learned only
that the navy yard was lost; and for anything
we knew to the contrary, Hampton
Roads might already be patrolled by rebel
gun-boats, and even Fortress Monroe might
have shared the fate of the navy yard. In
that case, it would be no place for an unarmed
transport, loaded with troops. As
we entered Chesapeake Bay and passed by
the suspicious locality, many eyes were
turned in that direction; and when fairly
out of reach of Hampton Roads, all felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
relieved that our way to Annapolis was
once more clear.</p>

<p>That night our course lay up the Chesapeake,
and at dawn on the 22d we were
anchored in the harbor of Annapolis. But
to the impatient and inexperienced volunteers
it seemed as though the complications
of our journey were to have no end. General
Butler had arrived the day before from
the head of the bay with the Eighth Massachusetts
regiment, on the steamer <i>Maryland</i>;
and he had rendered good service in saving
the United States school ship <i>Constitution</i>
from a threatened rebel attack by towing her
out from shore toward the harbor entrance.
But in doing so his own steamer had
grounded on a shallow bar, where she was
now lying hard and fast, with the Massachusetts
troops still on board. The first
thing to do was to release her, if possible,
from this awkward predicament. Our vessel,
the <i>Boston</i>, was again put under steam,
and harnessed with heaving-line and hawser
to the ferry-boat. Then she would go to
work like a willing draught-horse, and pull
this way and that for five minutes together,
straining every nerve to start her clumsy
load, but without effect. Her paddles only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
brought up from the bottom such clouds of
yellow foam that it made the narrow harbor
look like an enormous mud-puddle; and
with every new attempt we began to think
that instead of floating the <i>Maryland</i> we
should, in all likelihood, get stuck fast ourselves.
Finally, much to our relief, it was
decided to land the regiment and stores from
the <i>Boston</i>, and wait for another tide to
liberate the <i>Maryland</i>.</p>

<p>So, in the afternoon the regiment landed
and occupied the grounds of the Naval
Academy. There we found that many of the
officers and cadets had left for their southern
homes, to side with the rebellion. Even
some of those who remained were by no
means encouraging in their words or manner;
they were impregnated with the doctrine
of state sovereignty, as something
equal or superior to that of the nation, and
they had an exaggerated idea of the numbers
and audacity of the insurgents who
would occupy all roads and dispute every
mile of our advance. One of them told me
that he hoped that we would not attempt it;
and declared that if we did so, not half the
regiment would reach Washington alive.
I shall never forget the disgust that rose in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
my throat, at hearing a man with the uniform
of the United States on his shoulders
offer a welcome like that to volunteers who
were trying to save the government that
employed him.</p>

<p>The Governor of Maryland, who was
then at Annapolis, also protested against
any forward movement of the troops, and
even against their landing. But these official
fulminations had no longer any weight.
It was only the physical obstacles in our
way that were now to be considered. In
the evening the officers gathered in council
round a fire on the greensward, and it was
decided to move forward at once by the
most practicable route. While this was
going on, General Butler joined the group
and was invited to speak with the rest.
The extraordinary character of this man's
career from first to last, his many clever
successes and preposterous failures, and the
furious denunciations he has received from
both friends and enemies, make it hard to
say what place he will finally hold in public
estimation. But the qualities he displayed
on that occasion deserve the cordial recognition
and gratitude of all. When he spoke,
it was to the purpose. With a practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
insight and ready comprehension that took
in the situation at a glance, he swept away
in a few words the whole pretentious fabric
of state rights, local supremacy, inviolability
of the soil, and such like. The capital of
the nation, he said, was in danger from
armed rebellion. We were on our way to
protect it with an armed force. That was
a state of war; and it created a necessity
superior to every other claim or consideration.
All ordinary laws and authorities in
conflict with it must be in abeyance; and,
as for himself, he should lead his troops to
Washington, no matter who or what might
oppose his passage. More than that, he
should seize upon any property or means of
transportation necessary to accomplish the
object, without regard to governors, mayors,
or railroad companies.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that the Seventh <a name="p20_regiment" id="p20_regiment"></a>regiment
would have carried out its design if
General Butler had not been there; but it
was certain that his intellectual promptitude
and directness of speech imparted new confidence
to all who heard him. He struck
the same chord in his written correspondence
with Governor Hicks. During the day he
had received from the governor a formal communication,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
protesting against the "landing
of northern troops on the soil of Maryland;"&mdash;to
which he said in his reply: "These
are not northern troops, they are a part of
the whole militia of the United States, obeying
the call of the President." Now that
the question is settled, it seems plain enough.
But at that time it was a great satisfaction
to hear the doctrine of supreme nationality
proclaimed in the terse and expressive language
of General Butler.</p>

<p>It was intended that the regiment should
march for Washington by the direct country
road, a distance of about thirty miles; and
much of the time next day was spent in scouring
the neighborhood for horses, mules,
and wagons, to serve as ambulances and for
transporting the baggage and camp equipage.
But in the afternoon dispatches were
received from Washington, directing the
troops to come, if possible, by the Annapolis
branch of the Baltimore and Washington
railroad, in order that this important line of
communication might be kept open for
future use. This was a single-track road,
running twenty miles northwest from Annapolis
to its junction with the Baltimore and
Washington line. The depot at Annapolis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
was closed and abandoned by the company,
and the track had been disabled for some
distance out of town. When General Butler,
with two companies of the Eighth
Massachusetts, broke open the depot, he
found there a few passenger and platform
cars, with only one locomotive; and that
had been taken to pieces and rendered unserviceable.
But the Massachusetts regiment
was largely composed of mechanics,
who were not only good workmen but enterprising
and quick-witted. By a singular
chance one of them recognized, among the
fragments of the engine, a piece of machinery
which he had himself helped to make;
and he lost no time, with the aid of his comrades,
in putting together again the disjointed
limbs of the locomotive, and making
it in a few hours once more fit for work.
Others repaired the railroad track in the
neighborhood, and before dawn on the 24th
everything was ready for two companies of
the Seventh to move forward as advance
guard on the line of march.</p>

<p>Soon after daylight the whole regiment
was in motion. The locomotive and a
couple of platform cars were in front, carrying
a howitzer with its caisson; and one or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
two passenger and baggage cars served to
carry baggage and camp equipage, and to
provide for the transportation of sick or
wounded. The railroad embankment, which
was our only route, ran through a narrow
clearing in the woods, with low hills and
swampy lands alternating on either side.
The day was still and warm, and a few of
the men were prostrated by the unaccustomed
exertion and heat. About noon we
came up with the advance guard, and from
that point, after a short halt, all moved on
together. Missing rails and broken culverts
were a constant impediment to our
advance; and toward evening we came to
a deep and wide watercourse, where the long
trestle bridge had been burned a day or two
before. But these obstacles only seemed to
stimulate the volunteers. Heretofore their
annoyances and disappointments had been
from causes beyond their control. Now
that every difficulty was within reach, they
went at it with a will, and thought of nothing
but how to overcome it. The ruined
bridge hardly delayed them three hours.
The engineer officer and his men went into
the woods on each side, where a hundred
busy hands were soon at work, felling trees and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
hauling them into place; and before dark,
the stream was spanned by a new bridge of
rough-hewn timbers that carried the train
over safely, and our march began again.</p>

<p>So it went on all through the night.
The missing rails had often been thrown,
for better concealment, into some deep pool
or watercourse near by. But after a little
experience, that was the very first place
where they were sought for and generally
found. If the search proved ineffectual, it
made little difference at last; for at every
siding the extra rails were taken up and
carried forward on the train, to be used as
they might be needed further on. So the
track was made serviceable for ourselves,
and left in good condition for those who
were to follow. There was a line of skirmishers
in front and one on each flank, to beat
up the enemy, should he be there lying in
wait. Once or twice a few marauders were
sighted, tearing up the rails or reconnoitering
our advance; but they all retreated
promptly, without firing a shot or waiting
for the head of the column, and none of
them were even seen by the main body.
That was all. The desperate resistance we
were expected to meet with from swarming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
rebels and armed guerrillas turned out to be
a sham. When the advance guard about
daylight occupied the village of Annapolis
Junction, there was no opposition. The
regiment took possession of a deserted station,
and the railroad communication with
Washington at last was ours.</p>

<p>It is remarkable how greatly the presence
of an armed force conduces to friendly feeling
on the part of the inhabitants. No
doubt the secessionists hereabout had done
their best for a few days past to prevent our
ever arriving at Annapolis Junction. But
now that we were there, and especially in
need of a freshly cooked breakfast, there was
little difficulty in obtaining one for the officers'
mess. The fatigue and drowsiness
that had been almost overpowering during
the night, gave way like magic before the
refreshing stimulus of the dawn; and the
keen morning air awakened an appetite that
demanded something better than pork and
hardbread from the haversack. Among the
neighboring farmhouses there were some
quite ready to supply our wants.</p>

<p>Early in the forenoon a train made its
appearance from the direction of Washington.
It had been sent out to meet us, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
guard of a detachment of National Rifles,
a volunteer company of the District of
Columbia; and we were soon on board and
under way. The cars were crowded to the
utmost; but we were now nearing our destination,
and every discomfort seemed a
trifle. For some distance this side of
Washington the road was picketed; and
before long we began to see at intervals the
head and shoulders of a National Rifleman,
with his fresh looking uniform and glittering
bayonet, peering at us over the bushes as
the train went by. Finally, about noon, the
city came in sight. It was Thursday, the
25th. We had been six days in getting
from New York to Washington. They
had been days of doubt and anxiety, of
hindrances, delays, and stoppages. Every
hour was precious, and yet we knew that
with all possible dispatch we might still be
too late. And even now, at the outskirts of
the city, we could hardly help looking to
see whether the flag of the nation still floated
over the Capitol. The train rolled into
the depot, the regiment disembarked, formed
in column, marched to the White House,
reported to the President, and our journey
to Washington was accomplished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no doubt about the sense of
relief created by our arrival. After nearly
a week of isolation and peril, Washington
breathed more freely. The only troops
there before us were the Sixth Massachusetts,
a handful of regulars, and about thirty
volunteer companies of the District of
Columbia, mainly recent recruits. The
Seventh was a full regiment, well disciplined
and thoroughly equipped. What
was of still more consequence, it had opened
the door of Annapolis and reëstablished
communication with the north. The
Eighth Massachusetts arrived next day from
Annapolis Junction; and within another
week one more regiment from Massachusetts
and four from New York followed by
the same route. After that, the city of
Baltimore ceased to be an obstruction, and
the trains came through from Philadelphia
as usual. By the middle of May there were
nearly twenty-five thousand troops gathered
for the defense of Washington.</p>

<p>For the first week after our arrival we
were quartered in the Capitol building; but
at the end of that time the regiment went
into camp a mile or so north of the city,
on Meridian Hill. This was a plateau of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
about forty acres, admirably adapted for the
purpose. It was on the direct road to
Harper's Ferry, where the rebels were in
possession, and would give security against
incursions from that quarter. The camp
was on the east side of the road, where there
was a fine suburban estate, with a large,
square-built mansion house and outbuildings.
From the road entrance a well graded
avenue led up to the house porch, which
stretched its hospitable covering over the
carriage way. The house was occupied by
regimental headquarters and the staff officers.
In front were green fields and orchards,
falling away in a gentle slope toward the
city; and beyond was the broad Potomac,
with the Virginia shore and Arlington
Heights in the distance. In the rear were
the lines of company tents, and an ample
parade-ground, where the regiment was reviewed
every day or two by the President,
the Secretary of War, the general commanding,
or some other high civil or military
official, who was usually as much an object
of inspection to the troops as the troops
were to him.</p>

<p>By degrees other camps began to spring
up round about us. On the opposite side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
of the road were three regiments of New
Jersey volunteers, under General Runyon.
A field in front of us was the daily exercise
ground of a mounted battery of the regular
army; and farther down, on the left, was
the Twelfth regiment of New York volunteers.
The Eleventh New York, under
Colonel Ellsworth, was in camp below the
city beyond the navy yard. This regiment
was affiliated with our own through its second
officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Farnham,
who had been until then a lieutenant in the
Seventh, and had commanded the skirmish
line in the march from Annapolis.</p>

<p>The time was coming when the regiment
would have something else to do than drilling
and camp duty. Washington was saved
from the danger that menaced it at the outset;
and so long as the troops were there,
it was secure from a sudden inroad. But it
had no permanent defenses. The Potomac
River was the limit of its territory. On the
opposite shore the rising ground of Arlington
Heights commanded all approaches from
that direction; and every day, with a good
spyglass, we could see the fluttering of a
secession flag in the little city of Alexandria,
only six or seven miles away. This was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
precarious situation for the seat of government
and centre of military operations; and
no one was surprised when it made an attempt
to burst its shackles.</p>

<p>On the 23d of May, at midnight, the regiment
was put in motion and marched down
through the city, to the neighborhood of the
Long Bridge. Its departure had been quiet
and noiseless, as if the expedition were a
secret to all but the commanding officer. It
soon appeared, however, from signs that the
uninitiated are not slow to comprehend, that
something more was going on than the night
march of the regiment. The order to halt
came from other sources to our own commander.
After some delay, a part of the
New Jersey brigade came up from the rear
and passed on in advance; and there was
riding here and there of officers and messengers,
going and coming in various directions.
Nevertheless, everything was done in silence.
Not even the occupants of the neighboring
houses seemed to be awakened or disturbed;
and it gave to the scene a mysterious kind of
interest to feel that we were on some errand
that neither friends nor enemies were to
know of until it was accomplished.</p>

<p>Again our column was on the march, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
we soon found ourselves at the entrance of the
Long Bridge. We passed between the two
guard-houses, under the black timbers of the
draw-frame, and over its three quarters of a
mile of roadway to the Virginia shore. It
was the first hour of a moonlight night, and
half a mile farther on, at daybreak, the regiment
was halted and went into bivouac on
an open field by the roadside.</p>

<p>Not long after sunrise a horseman came
clattering along the road from the direction
of Alexandria, and as he galloped by
toward the bridge, he flung out to us the
news, "Alexandria is taken, and Colonel
Ellsworth is killed."</p>

<p>This was one of the minor events in the
early part of the war that excited a wide-spread
interest, mainly from the dramatic
features of the incident. The Eleventh New
York had reached Alexandria by steamer,
and landed there about daylight. Immediately
after disembarking, Colonel Ellsworth
had left his regiment, and with a
small squad hastened to secure the telegraph
office, to prevent communication with the
south. That done, he noticed, flying above
the principal hotel in the town, a secession
flag. It was the flag we had seen so often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
for the last fortnight from the direction of
Washington. The colonel effected an entrance,
and with his companions mounted to
the roof, hauled down the flag, and brought
it away with him. When about halfway
down he was shot dead by the keeper of the
hotel, who was lying in wait for him with a
double-barreled gun. Instantly the soldier
next him discharged his musket in the face
of the homicide, and, driving his bayonet
through his breast, hurled his body down the
remaining stairway; so that within a minute
both the colonel and his assailant were dead
men. None of those in the hotel knew of
the arrival of the regiment, and probably
thought they had to do only with a few
raiders from abroad.</p>

<p>This news of the occupation of Alexandria
was our first intimation of the actual
extent of the movement we were engaged
in. The truth was that between midnight
and dawn about 12,000 men had crossed the
Potomac by the two bridges at Washington
and Georgetown, beside the Eleventh regiment
which went by steamer. They were
to hold and fortify a defensive line extending
from below Alexandria, around Arlington
Heights, to the Potomac River above Georgetown;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
comprising, when all complete, a
chain of twenty-three forts, for the permanent
security of the city on its southern side.
Our own destination was a locality not far
from our first bivouac, and where the New
Jersey troops, who had gone before, were
already breaking ground for the trenches.</p>

<p>Next day the men of the Seventh were
also set to work with pick and spade and
barrow, excavating the ditch and piling up
the rampart along the lines laid down by the
engineers. One fatigue party followed another,
all doing their best, like so many ants
on an ant-hill; and before night the place
began to look something like a fortification.
When finished it was the largest of those on
the south side of the river, occupying a space
of about fourteen acres. It was an inclosed
bastioned work, covering the two forks of
the road; one leading south to Alexandria,
the other southwest toward Fairfax Court
House. It defended the Long Bridge, and
secured its possession for ingress and egress.
It was named Fort Runyon, in honor of the
general commanding the New Jersey brigade.</p>

<p>After a few days on the Virginia shore, the
regiment was ordered back to its camp at
Meridian Hill. It had been mustered into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
service for one month, to meet an emergency
which was now past. Orders for its return
north were received on the 30th of May;
and on the 31st it broke camp and embarked
for New York, arriving there on the 1st of
June. It was then mustered out of service,
having been under arms forty-three days.</p>

<p>This was the "Washington campaign"
of the Seventh regiment. It was a campaign
without a battle, and the regiment was not
once under fire from the enemy. Its only
casualties were one man killed in camp by
the accidental discharge of a musket, and another
wounded in the leg by his own pistol.
But it came to the front at a time when one
battalion for the moment was more needed
than a brigade afterward. Though mustered
out as a regiment, it at once began to supply
material for other organizations. Of its
members in 1861, more than six hundred
entered the service during the war; over
fifty became regimental commanders; from
twenty to thirty, brigadier-generals; and more
than one reached the grade of major-general.
With all this depletion, its ranks were kept
tolerably full by new recruits, and it was
twice afterward called into the field for temporary
duty, once in 1862, and again in 1863.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="THE_EXPEDITION_TO_PORT" id="THE_EXPEDITION_TO_PORT"></a>THE EXPEDITION TO PORT
ROYAL.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">After</span> my return from Washington in
1861, I resigned my commission in
the Seventh regiment, and looked for an
opportunity of more permanent connection
with the service.</p>

<p>The most attractive position which offered
was that of surgeon of brigade, recently established
by act of Congress; and, a medical
board having been convened for the examination
of candidates, I appeared before
it, passed the examination, and in due time
received my commission as Brigade Surgeon
of Volunteers.</p>

<p>At that time each volunteer regiment had
its surgeon and assistant surgeon, who were
in general quite competent to the work they
had to do. Like other regimental officers,
they received their appointments and commissions
from the authorities of their own
state, and were permanently attached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
their particular regiments, without being
either authorized or required to go elsewhere.</p>

<p>But when the volunteer army came to be
organized into brigades, under command of
brigadier generals with a general staff, it
was found that there were no medical officers
to correspond. They were needed to
receive and consolidate the regimental reports,
inspect the health of the commands,
establish field hospitals, and perform in every
way the duties of a general medical officer.
Such places were filled, so far as possible,
by the surgeons and assistant surgeons of
the regular army. But these were too few
in number to provide for the large volunteer
force suddenly called into action; and for
that reason the new grade of brigade surgeon
was created. My commission was
dated August 3, 1861.</p>

<p>But it was not until the first week in
October that I received orders to report in
Washington at army headquarters. On
arriving there, I was directed to join General
Viele's brigade and report for duty to that
officer.</p>

<p>General Viele's brigade was at Annapolis.
So, as soon as possible, I proceeded, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
my horse, baggage, and camp equipage, to
Annapolis Junction, and thence, by the
branch road that I had traveled with the
Seventh, to Annapolis. There I found the
general and his staff, quartered in the old
St. John's College, a little outside the town.
A locality always looks different when
you are arriving and when you are going
away; and, notwithstanding my brief acquaintance
with Annapolis six months before,
now that I was coming to it from a
different direction and for another purpose,
I should hardly have known it for the same
place.</p>

<p>The building where we were quartered
was a plain brick edifice, several stories in
height, facing the town, with a distant view
of the harbor beyond. In front was the
college green, where some of the regiments
were paraded for the presentation of flags.
One of these presentations was made, a week
after my arrival, by Governor Hicks, who
had now seen his way clear to support the
Union. In the rear and to the westward
were the regimental camps.</p>

<p>It soon appeared that the troops were
gathering at Annapolis in considerable force.
In all, there were three brigades: General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Viele's, General Stevens's, and General
Wright's,&mdash;the whole forming a division
of a little over twelve thousand men, under
command of General W. T. Sherman. In
General Viele's brigade there were five regiments,&mdash;the
Forty-sixth, Forty-seventh,
and Forty-eighth New York, the Third
New Hampshire, and Eighth Maine. This
brigade was the earliest on the ground and
ranked first in the division. General Stevens's
was the second brigade, and General
Wright's the third. Each had a brigade
surgeon; and a chief medical officer, from
the regular army, was attached to the staff
of the division commander.</p>

<p>It was also claimed that we were going
somewhere. Already a number of transports
were in the bay, and others continued
to arrive, evidently for our accommodation.
Orders from the commanding general or his
adjutant were dated: "Headquarters, Division
E. C." These cabalistic letters were
supposed to indicate in some way our future
destination, though I do not remember ever
seeing them, either written or printed, except
as initials. After a time they were
understood to mean Expeditionary Corps;
but that hardly made us much wiser as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
how far or in what direction we were
bound.</p>

<p>At the end of a fortnight all was ready.
One by one the transports came into the
harbor and took on their load of stores,
artillery, ammunition, and wagons; and
finally the troops embarked. Our own vessel,
occupied by General Viele and his staff,
was the <i>Oriental</i>, an iron-built ocean steamer
of nine hundred tons, formerly a packet running
to Havana. She also carried provisions
and ordnance, and one or two companies
of soldiers belonging to the brigade.</p>

<p>After saying good-by to Annapolis, our
vessels steamed slowly together down the
broad highway of the Chesapeake, past the
mouth of the Potomac river, almost as broad,
and the next day came to anchor in Hampton
Roads. So far, our voyage was only a
preliminary. We had arrived at a second
rendezvous, where the remainder of the
expedition was in waiting; and we now
began to have an idea of its real magnitude.
Grouped around us over the ample roadstead,
there were war vessels of all grades
and dimensions, from a steam frigate to a
gunboat. Whether they were all to go
with us we knew not, but the number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
coaling schooners lying about seemed to
indicate that most of them were under sailing
orders.</p>

<p>However, there was more waiting to be
done before the final start, and we passed a
week without shifting our anchorage. Not
being responsible for anything outside our
own brigade, we devoted ourselves mainly
to cultivating the virtue of patience. Yet
we could not help feeling that such a military
and naval demonstration, gathered at
such a point, could not long remain a secret;
and that, wherever we might be bound, if it
were any object to arrive without being expected,
the sooner we could get away the
better. For medical officers there was another
cause of anxiety, which I began to
appreciate almost as soon as our anchor was
down. When soldiers are on land it is always
possible to care for their sanitary condition.
Camps can be cleansed and drained,
or shifted to better ground; and the sick
can be placed in hospital, or isolated at a respectable
distance from the rest. But how
to do this with troops confined within the
narrow quarters of a ship? And what if
some contagion should break out among
them, like smouldering fire in a haystack?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Every exertion was made to keep the transports
in fair condition as to cleanliness and
ventilation, and to watch for the appearance
of any suspicious malady. But every day
made it more difficult to do the one, and
added to the danger of the other. Fortunately,
we got through without any serious
mishap of this kind.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we had some entertainment
in watching our naval colleagues, and trying
to learn what and who they were. They
were in frequent communication with each
other or with the shore; and their trim
barges, with the regular dip of their oars,
and a kind of scientific certainty about the
way they went through the water, contrasted
well with the rather sprawly fashion of our
own boats and their soldier crews. The
commander of the naval force was Captain
Dupont.</p>

<p>His flagship, the <i>Wabash</i>, a double deck
steam frigate of forty guns, was the most
imposing object in view. Then came the
sloops-of-war <i>Mohican</i>, <i>Seminole</i>, and <i>Pawnee</i>,
with gunboats of various sizes, and the
great transports <i>Atlantic</i>, <i>Baltic</i>, and <i>Vanderbilt</i>,
each of about 3000 tons burden;
making altogether, with the additional transports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and supply boats, a fleet of nearly fifty
vessels.</p>

<p>At last the preparations were complete,
and on Tuesday, October 29th, the signal for
starting was given. Away from Hampton
Roads, through the mouth of the Chesapeake,
past the capes of Virginia, and then at sea,
with prows toward the south, the stately
procession moved along, every vessel in its
place. The flagship led the van, with other
men-of-war trailing behind, like ripples, in
two diverging lines. Then came the transports
in three columns, formed by the three
brigades, and lastly a few gunboats brought
up the rear. The vessels of the first brigade
formed the right column, and as the sun
went down the Virginia shore was just sinking
out of sight. The weather was favorable,
and every one felt pleased to see the
expedition now fairly on its way.</p>

<p>Our progress was not very rapid. Many
of the war vessels were slow-going craft, and
the rest had to accommodate their speed to
the leisurely rate of five or six knots. We
were fully twenty-four hours in making Cape
Hatteras; and, notwithstanding the bad reputation
of this locality, we found there
hardly enough wind and sea to be uncomfortable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
The main topic of talk was our
destination. No one in the fleet knew what
that was except the two commanders, Captain
Dupont and General Sherman. The
commanding officer on each vessel brought
with him sealed orders, which he was not to
open unless separated from the rest. But all
were at liberty to guess; and in our discussions
there were three objective points favored
by the knowing ones; Bull's Bay on
the coast of South Carolina, Port Royal entrance
about a hundred miles farther down,
and Fernandina in Florida. As I knew them
all only as so many names on the map, and
had no idea why one should be a more desirable
conquest than the other, I listened
for entertainment, without caring to choose
between them. Our military family was
made up of various elements, but all were
good-natured and companionable, and promised
to grow still better on acquaintance.
General Viele was a graduate of West Point,
and we all looked to him for information in
regard to military affairs.</p>

<p>The order of sailing became somewhat
deranged after a time, though at the end of
two days we were still in sight of the flagship,
with from thirty to forty others in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
horizon. So far, the weather had given us
no trouble. But on Friday, November 1st,
it began to be rough. The sky was overcast,
the ship rolled and pitched, and the
wind howled in a way that gave warning of
worse to come. As the day wore on, there
was no improvement, and before nightfall
it was blowing a gale.</p>

<p>There is a difference between a storm and
a gale of wind. A storm is disagreeable
enough, with the driving rain, the lead-colored
sky, the sea covered with foam, and
the wet decks all going up and down hill.
There is not much pleasure while that lasts.
But in a gale of wind, discomfort is not what
you think of. After the tempest has grown
and gathered strength for five or six hours
together, it begins to look threatening and
wicked. The sea is a black gulf around the
ship; and the great waves come rolling at
her, one after the other, like troops of hungry
wolves furious to swallow her up. A thousand
more are behind them, and she has to
fight them all, single handed, for life or
death. She must keep her head steady to
the front, and meet every billow as it comes
without faltering or flinching; for if she
loses courage or strength and falls away to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
leeward, the next big comber will topple
over her side and she will go under.</p>

<p>When a good ship is wrestling with such
a sea, she does it almost like a living creature.
She sways and settles, and rises and
twists, and her beams groan and creak with
the strain that is on them. But her joints
hold, and she answers her helm; and the
steady pulsation of her engines gives assurance
of undiminished vitality and motive
power. So long as she behaves in this way,
you know that she is equal to the work.
But what if the sea should grow yet fiercer
and heavier, and buffet her with redoubled
energy till she is maimed or exhausted?
She is a mechanical construction, knit together
with bolts and braces; and the steam
from her boilers is to her the breath of life.
However stanch and true, her power of
resistance is limited. But in the elements
there is a reserve of force and volume that
is immeasurable; and when they once begin
to run riot, no one can tell how severe it may
become or how long it will last.</p>

<p>So it was on board the <i>Oriental</i>. All
that evening the wind increased in violence.
Every hour it blew harder, and the waves
came faster and bigger than before. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
sea was no longer a highway; it was a tossing
chaos of hills and valleys, sweeping toward
us from the southeast with the force of
the tornado, and reeling and plunging about
us on every side. The ship was acting well,
and showed no signs of distress thus far; but
by midnight it seemed as though she had
about as much as she could do. The officers
and crew did their work in steady, seamanlike
fashion, and among the soldiers
there was no panic or bustle. Once in a while
I would get up out of my berth, to look at the
ship from the head of the companion way,
or to go forward between decks and listen
to the pounding of the sea against her bows.
At one o'clock, for the first time, things were
no longer growing worse; and in another
hour or two it was certain that the gale had
reached its height. Then I turned in for
sleep, wedged myself into the berth with the
blankets, and made no more inspection tours
that night.</p>

<p>Next morning the wind had somewhat
abated, though the sea was still rolling hard,
under the impetus of an eighteen hours'
blow. The ship was uninjured and everything
on board in good condition. But
where was the fleet? Of all the splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
company that left Hampton Roads four days
ago, only two or three were in sight, looking
disconsolate enough and pitching about like
eggshells. We knew afterward that two of
them had gone down, one had thrown overboard
her battery of eight guns to keep from
foundering, and others had turned back, disabled,
for Fortress Monroe. But on the
whole, most of them had escaped serious
damage, and, like ourselves, were again making
headway toward the south. Nevertheless
it was a lonely day, and at nightfall we
had no more companions about us than there
were in the morning.</p>

<p>By this time we knew our destination.
The sealed orders were opened and the ship
put on her course. The next day, Sunday,
was bright and clear, with a smooth sea.
Other vessels began to appear, moving in
the same direction; and before noon we were
off Port Royal entrance, with ten or eleven
ships in company. Stragglers continued to
come up as the time passed, and on Monday
morning when the flagship arrived, there
were already twenty-five or thirty sail around
her.</p>

<p>Any land looks pleasant from the sea,
when you have been knocking about for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
some days in bad weather; and the South
Carolina shore had a particularly attractive
appearance for us, partly no doubt because
we knew it would still be rather hard work
getting there. It was ten miles away, but
the mirage made it visible; and the long
stretch of beaches and low sand bluffs, with
their rows of pines, all sleeping in the quiet
sunshine, had a kind of luxurious, semi-tropical
look, at least to the imagination. Every
light-house and buoy had been removed, and
not a sign was left for guidance over the
bar. But soon a busy little steamer was at
work, sounding out the channel and placing
buoys; and in the afternoon all except the
deeper-draft vessels went in. We were
among the first of the lot; and of those that
followed, many showed the marks of their
rough treatment at sea. The big sidewheel
steamer, <i>Winfield Scott</i>, came in dismasted,
and with a great patch of canvas over her
bows, looking like a man with a broken
head. Others had lost smoke-stacks, or
stove bulwarks or wheel-houses. But when
all that could get over the bar were collected
inside, they still made a respectable fleet.
The heavier vessels had to wait for another
tide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>That was early next morning, when the
<i>Wabash</i> came in, followed by the rest.
A weather-beaten old tar was standing in
her fore channels outside the bulwarks, feeling
her way with lead and line; and as the
great ship moved slowly by, we could hear
his doleful, monotonous chant, "By the
ma-ark fi-ive," telling that she was in thirty
feet of water and going safely along. She
passed through the fleet of transports and
war vessels to her position in advance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile several gunboats had gone up
the harbor, to learn something about the
forts. They were firing away now and then,
either at the enemy on shore or at the rebel
gunboats hovering about beyond. We supposed
that their errand was only preliminary,
and felt no surprise at seeing them return
after an hour or two and again quietly come
to anchor. But in the afternoon, when the
flagship herself got under way, we expected
something more; especially as she had undergone
a transformation and was now in
fighting trim. Her topmasts were sent down,
and all her lofty tracery of spars had disappeared.
As she moved off, looking like
a champion athlete stripped for the fray,
every eye followed her in eager expectation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Soon a puff of smoke from one of the rebel
batteries, followed by the dull reverberation
of the report, and then another from the
opposite shore, spoke out their defiance, as
if they would like nothing better than to
begin hostilities at once. But there was no
answering gun from the frigate. On she
went, in the same leisurely fashion, as if she
had seen and heard nothing. More guns
from the forts, more smoke and more reverberation.
Now she will surely open her
ports and show these blustering rebels, at
least with a shot or two, what it is to
fire upon a United States frigate. But no.
She seemed to pause awhile as if in doubt,
then turned and came slowly back toward
the fleet, followed to all appearance by the
parting scoffs of the enemy. It was impossible
to repress a certain feeling of chagrin
at seeing the flagship apparently chased
out of the harbor, on the first trial, without
even firing once in reply.</p>

<p>That was because we had been looking
at something we did not understand. After
getting the reports of the gunboats, the
flagship had gone up to obtain for herself a
few more particulars as to the location and
outline of the forts. The cannonading was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
at too long range to do her any harm, and
her expedition was meant for business, not
for show.</p>

<p>However, the next day must find us ready;
and perhaps it would be none too soon.
We had now been four days, off and on, at
the harbor entrance; and by this time all
South Carolina knew where we were and
what we had come for. Every additional
twenty-four hours gave the enemy more
time for preparation, without any advantage
to us; and the longer the enterprise was
deferred, the more difficult it would become.
But the next day there was rather a high
wind, with considerable sea; and accordingly
matters again remained <i>in statu quo</i>. That
was another disappointment. It seemed
almost impossible that it should be so.
Were these old sea-dogs, after coming six
hundred miles on purpose, to be delayed in
their work by a little rough water?</p>

<p>Well, yes. This was to be a contest
between ships and forts. The forts are
planted on the solid ground, and their guns
are mounted on level platforms, with every
angle of inclination sure and uniform. But
the ships are afloat; and if rolling about with
the sea, and their decks tipping this way and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
that, their aim must be uncertain and much
of their metal thrown away. Of course, a
fort is not to be reduced by firing guns at it,
but by having the shot penetrate where it is
meant to go. Captain Dupont was a man
who had come to win, not to fight a useless
battle with no result; and the way he went
to work after the time arrived made it plain
to all that he knew equally well when to
stop and when to go ahead.</p>

<p>On the morning of Thursday, November
7th, everything was favorable. The sea was
smooth, with a gentle breeze from the northeast.
About nine o'clock the war vessels
began to move forward between the forts.
The transports were drawn up as near as
possible and yet be out of the line of fire.
Our own vessel, the <i>Oriental</i>, was the second
in position, General Sherman's being the only
one in advance of us. As for myself, I
climbed into the fore cross-trees, and then,
seated on the reefed topsail, with my back
against the foot of the topmast, I had a view
that commanded the entire scene. It was a
bright, clear day, with hardly a cloud on the
horizon. Before us lay the broad harbor
nearly two and a half miles across, guarded
on each side by the enemy's earthworks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
On the right, at Bay Point, was Fort Beauregard,
and on the left, at Hilton Head, Fort
Walker, the stronger and more important
of the two. A little to the north of Fort
Walker was a high, two-story house, with a
veranda in front, the headquarters of the
rebel commander; and away beyond, moving
about in the adjoining creeks, we could see
the tall smoke-stacks and black smoke of
the rebel gunboats, watching an opportunity
to capture vessels that might be stranded or
crippled, or to chase them all, should they
be defeated.</p>

<p>And now the battle began. The naval
force in a long line of fifteen ships, passed
up midway between the forts, receiving and
answering the fire from each. Near the
head of the harbor, five or six were thrown
off for a flanking squadron, to engage the
rebel gunboats or enfilade the enemy's works
from the north. The rest, including all the
larger vessels, then turned south, and, passing
slowly down in front of Fort Walker, gave
her, one after the other, their heavy broadsides,
turning again, after getting fairly by,
to repeat the circuit. From my position I
could see every shell strike. When one of
them buried itself in the ramparts or plunged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
over into the fort, its explosion would throw
up a vertical column of whirling sand high
in the air, followed by another almost as
soon as the first had disappeared. When
one from the rebel batteries burst over the
ships, it appeared suddenly like a white ball
of smoke against the sky, that swelled and
expanded into a cloudy globe, and then
slowly drifted away to leeward; while a few
seconds later came the sharp detonation of
the exploded shell. On both sides the conflict
was unremitting, and along the whole
sea-face of the fort its guns kept on belching
their volleys against the fleet.</p>

<p>About this time we noticed on our left,
close in shore, a gunboat that seemed to be
engaging the fort on its own hook. It was
a two-masted vessel, probably of six or seven
hundred tons, but it looked hardly larger
than a good sized steam tug; and on its
open deck was a single big gun, firing away
at the southeast angle of the fort. It was
the <i>Pocahontas</i>. She had been kept back
by the gale, and had just arrived in time to
get over the bar while the fight was going
on. Her commander was Captain Percival
Drayton, a native of South Carolina, but one
of the stanchest and most gallant officers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the navy of the United States. The commander
of the two forts was his brother,
General Drayton, of the Confederate army,
whose plantation on the island was only two
or three miles away.</p>

<p>When looking at the new comer, I could
not help thinking how much expression
there may be in such inanimate things as
two pieces of ordnance. The way the gun
on the <i>Pocahontas</i> was worked certainly gave
the idea of skill, determination, and persistency;
while that which answered it from the
fort was equally suggestive of vexation, haste,
and a little apprehension. No doubt it was
natural for the defenders to feel so, when, in
addition to the cannonading in front and on
one flank, another enemy should appear, to
harass them from the opposite quarter.</p>

<p>Through all this hurly-burly, the movement
of the war vessels was a masterpiece
of concerted action. Round and round they
went, following the flagship in deliberate succession,
pounding at the fort with one broadside
going up and with the other coming
down. So far as we could see, not one of
them fell out of line, or failed to do her full
share in the engagement. It had been going
on now nearly four hours. The fire of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
fort was somewhat lessened, but it was still
enough to be doubtful and dangerous. One
great gun in particular, on the southern half
of the sea-front, kept working away with
dogged energy, as if determined to inflict
some deadly blow that might retrieve the
fortunes of the day. After a while there
seemed to be a cessation. The <i>Wabash</i>
stood motionless before her enemy. She
fired a single gun, to which there was no
response. Then a boat shot out from under
her quarter; and pulled straight for the
shore. An officer landed, and went up the
bluffs to the fort. For a moment we could
see his dark figure running round the parapet,
then down and out by the sally-port,
and across the intervening field to the two-story
house, where it disappeared in the
doorway. A few moments later, at the
flagstaff on the roof, a flag mounted swiftly
to the top, and then, in sight of all, the stars
and stripes floated out with the breeze, over
the coast of South Carolina.</p>

<p>What followed was a kind of pandemonium.
Cheers from the vessels all over
the harbor, with the tooting of steam whistles
and music from the regimental bands,
mingled in long reiteration till every vocal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
organ was exhausted, and the notes of the
"Star-spangled Banner" had traveled over
the Bay Point and back again. The transports
began to move in, and were soon collected
as near the beach as they could safely
come. In an hour or two I went ashore
with General Viele and others of his staff, to
take a look at the surroundings. The fort
was naturally our first object of interest.
Three of its guns dismounted, with their
gun-carriages standing wrong end upward,
the parapet and traverses seamed with shot
and shell, and the ground strewn with pieces
of exploded projectiles, told of the hard
struggle it had gone through. The few
dead left by the enemy had been decently
removed by the marines who first took possession.
A day or two afterward the surgeon
of the fort was found in one of the galleries,
dead, and covered with sand from a bursted
shell. In the rear of the fort was a stretch
of open plain, also covered with fragments of
shell, over which the fugitives had passed in
their final rout, leaving behind arms, knapsacks,
blankets, and everything that could
impede their flight. Traveling over this
field, half a mile or so from the fort, I came
upon the body of a stout fellow, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
been struck down while running for his life.
There was a gaping wound in his breast,
into which you might have put a quart pot;
but his countenance was as serene and quiet
in expression as if he had laid down by himself
for a few moments' rest.</p>

<p>General Wright's brigade was landed that
afternoon. But it was slow work, with a
shelving beach and no wharf; and the rest
of us postponed disembarking till the next
day. When all were on shore, General
Wright's command was located at and about
the fort, and that of General Stevens some
distance farther on, near the crossing of a
tide-water creek. Our own brigade, which
held the advanced position, was about two
miles northwest of the creeks, on the main
road from that direction. The fort at Bay
Point was abandoned by the enemy without
further resistance, and was occupied by a
detachment from the second brigade.</p>

<p>I have understood that this battle made
some change in current opinion as to the
efficiency of ships and forts against each
other. A fort, or at least an earthwork,
would seem almost impregnable against artillery.
It has no masonry walls to crumble
or batter down. Solid shot may bury themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
in its ramparts without doing the least
harm; and when a shell explodes there, it
only throws up a volcanic eruption of earth
and sand, that settles back again nearly in
the same place. The day after the battle at
Hilton Head, the walls of the fort were
practically as good as ever, and within a
week or two its scarred outlines were all
smoothed over again. On the other hand,
a frigate or a sloop-of-war is vulnerable
throughout. A single shot at the water line
will make a leak, hot shot will set her on
fire, and exploding shells may derange her
machinery. Her oaken sides are a slight
bulwark compared with the twenty feet of
earth in the ramparts of a fort.</p>

<p>All this was thoroughly appreciated by
the enemy, who were prepared for the attack
and confident of success. Captured letters
and documents showed that they had entire
faith in their works and guns, and fully expected
to sink the Yankee vessels and teach
them a lesson for their temerity.</p>

<p>But in one thing ships may be superior to
forts; that is, in their power of defensive
action. What decides the day more than
anything else is the number of guns in service
and the rapidity of their fire. Ships may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
be brought from various directions and concentrated
at a given place, so that their
united batteries will far outweigh the armament
of a fort. At Hilton Head the <i>Wabash</i>
alone fired, in four hours, 880 shot and shell;
and from the entire fleet no less than 2000
projectiles must have been hurled upon the
fort within that time. The earthwork itself
may withstand this tempest, but its defenders
cannot continue to work their guns.
After a time their fortitude must give way
under such a trial, and, as it was in Fort
Walker, the moment comes at last for a
final stampede. Of course, this implies that
the ships are present in sufficient force and
do their work in the right way.</p>

<p>But perhaps the victory was due, more
than anything else, to the practical skill and
originality of Captain Dupont. He saw at
once that the work at Hilton Head was the
important one, and that if that were reduced,
the other would be untenable. When first
leading his ships up the harbor in mid-channel,
he engaged both forts at about two thousand
yards distance. On making the turn
and coming down again towards the south,
he passed in front of Fort Walker at eight
hundred yards. This distance was of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
own choosing, and he had the range beforehand.
But the guns of the fort had to be
sighted anew, in the heat and excitement of
actual conflict; not an easy thing to do,
even for the most experienced. After going
again toward the north at longer range, he
once more made the turn and repassed the
fort on his way back, this time at six hundred
yards. So, the vessels were always in
motion, and after every turn presented themselves
to the enemy at a different distance.
It was this second promenade of the ships,
pouring into the fort their terrific broadsides
at the short distance of six hundred yards,
that did the effective work of the engagement.
At this time, according to nearly all
the commanders' reports, the enemy's shot
mostly passed over the ships, injuring only
their spars and rigging. Throughout the
battle none of them were struck more than
ten times in the hull, none were seriously
disabled, and two of them were not hit at all.
Captain Dupont said afterward that he believed
he had saved a hundred lives by engaging
the fort at close range.</p>

<p>After the first rejoicings were over, there
was a singular feeling of disappointment in
the North at the seeming want of result from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the victory at Port Royal. It was expected
that the troops would move at once into the
interior, capture the important cities, and
revolutionize the states of Georgia and South
Carolina. One of the newspaper correspondents
wrote home, a few days after the
battle, "In three weeks we shall be in
Charleston and Savannah;" and in the popular
mind at that time the possession of a city
seemed more important than anything else,
in the way of military success. So when
the months of November, December, and
January passed by, without anything being
done that the public could appreciate, there
was no little surprise manifested at the inactivity
of the army in South Carolina.</p>

<p>In reality the military commanders were
busy from the outset. The day after the
battle, Captain Gillmore, the chief engineer,
made a <a name="p62_reconnaissance" id="p62_reconnaissance"></a>reconnaissance to the north side of
the island, and laid out there a work to control
the interior water-way between Charleston
and Savannah; and before the end of
the month he had commenced his plans for
the reduction of Fort Pulaski, which in
due time were brought to a successful issue.
But these movements, and others like them,
were after all secondary in importance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the main object of the Port Royal expedition,
namely, the permanent acquisition of
Port Royal itself, as an aid to the naval
operations on the Atlantic coast.</p>

<p>The government at Washington was by
this time fully alive to the magnitude of the
contest and its requirements. One of the
most pressing of these requirements was the
blockade; which must be maintained effectively
along an extensive line of coast, exposed
to severe weather during a large part
of the year. The vessels of the blockading
squadron must be supplied with stores and
coal at great inconvenience and from a long
distance; and when one of them needed repairs
it must be sent all the way to New
York or Philadelphia to get a new topmast
or chain cable. This involved much expense,
long delays, and the risk of temporary
inefficiency in the blockade. It was important
that the fleet should have, near at hand,
a capacious harbor, where store-houses and
workshops might be established, and where
shelter might be had for the necessary inspections
and repairs. Port Royal was such a
harbor; and it also served, in course of time,
as a base for further military operations. It
had been selected by Captain Dupont and
General Sherman in joint council.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="THE_SEA_ISLANDS_AND_FORT" id="THE_SEA_ISLANDS_AND_FORT"></a>THE SEA ISLANDS AND FORT
PULASKI.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> sea islands of South Carolina and
Georgia are grouped in a nearly continuous
chain along the coast, between the
mainland and the sea. They are flat, with
only a few slight elevations here and there;
and there is not, over their whole area, a
single boulder, pebble, or gravel bed, nor any
spot where the ledge rock comes to the surface.
The soil at first seems to be sandy;
but you soon discover that it has mingled
with it a fine black loam and is extremely
productive. It yields the "sea-island cotton,"
a variety of long fibre, formerly much
valued for certain purposes of textile manufacture.
There is no sod or turf, like that
of the Northern states, but the fields not
under cultivation produce a tall thin grass,
which is soon trampled out of existence by
passing wagons or by soldiers on the march.
In the clearings are the live oak and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
great magnolia, both evergreen. The palmetto
is also a conspicuous object, and the
dwarf palmetto grows abundantly under the
shadow of the pine woods. Everywhere there
is a large proportion of hard-wood shrubs
and trees with polished, waxy-looking, evergreen
leaves.</p>

<p>There are many extensive plantations,
where the owners often remain during a
large part of the year. Their houses are
not grouped in villages, but scattered at a
considerable distance apart, each on its own
plantation, with the negro cabins usually in
long lines at the rear or on one side. The
roads from one plantation to another run
through the pine woods, or over the plains,
bordered on each side by cotton or corn fields,
and marking the only division between them.
There is seldom to be seen such a thing as
a rail fence, and of course never a stone wall.</p>

<p>Hilton Head, where we were now encamped,
was one of the largest of these islands.
It was twelve miles long, in a general
east and west direction, and about five
miles in extreme width, north and south. At
its Port Royal end, the sand bluffs rose to the
height of eight or ten feet above the beach,
giving the name of "head" more especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
to this part of the island; elsewhere they
were generally much lower. Along its sea-front
there was a magnificent beach, ten
miles long, broken only at one place by a
creek fordable at half tide. At frequent
intervals on this route there were marks of
the slow encroachment of the sea upon the
land. Often you would come upon the
white, dry stump of a dead pine, standing
up high above the beach on the ends of its
sprawling roots, like so many corpulent
spider legs. Once it grew on the low bluffs
above high-water mark, as its descendants
are doing now. But the sea gradually undermined
its roots and washed out the soil
from between them, till it gave up the ghost
for want of nourishment, and in time came
to be stranded here, half-way down the
beach. It looked as if the tree had moved
down from the bluffs toward the water,
though in reality the beach had moved up
past the tree. The same thing was going
on all along the coast in this region. There
were trees on the very edge of the bluff,
with their roots toward the sea exposed and
bare, but with enough still buried in the
soil on the land side to hold the trunk upright
and give it sap; while here and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
was one already losing its grip and slowly
bending over toward the sea. When it has
nothing more to rest on than the sands of
the beach, its branches and trunk decay, but
its roots and stump remain for many years
whitening in the sun, like a skeleton on the
plains.</p>

<p>The chain of islands from Port Royal
toward Charleston harbor included Parry,
Saint Helena, Edisto, John's and James
islands; in the opposite direction, toward
the Savannah river, Daufuskie, Turtle, and
Jones' islands. Inside these were other
smaller islands, the whole separated from
each other and from the mainland by sounds
and creeks, sometimes broad but oftener
narrow and tortuous, through which small
steamers could find an inside passage from
Charleston to Savannah. This communication
was of course cut off when our troops
occupied Port Royal.</p>

<p>At Hilton Head I first made the acquaintance
of the southern plantation negro.
Every white inhabitant had disappeared, leaving
the slaves alone in possession. Their
inferior appearance, habits, and qualities, their
curious lingo and strange pronunciation were
in amusing contrast with those of the blacks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and mulattoes we had seen at the north.
When I met one of them near the Jones
plantation and asked him whether he belonged
there, his answer was this: "No
mawse, I no bene blahnx mawse Jones, I
bene blahnx mawse Elliot." Not having any
idea what he meant, I repeated the phrase
to General Viele, who had some familiarity
with the southern negro, and who gave me
the interpretation as follows: "No master,
I did not belong to master Jones, I belonged
to master Elliot." Mr. Elliot was
the owner of another plantation near by.
Soon after we took possession of Hilton
Head, negroes began to come in from the
neighboring islands, seeking shelter and
food. They generally appeared to rate themselves
at the value set upon them by their
former masters. One morning a young
black, of the deepest dye and most cheerful
expression of countenance, presented himself
at brigade headquarters, and on being
asked whether any others had arrived with
him, he said with a delighted grin: "Yes,
mawse, more 'n two hundred head o' nigger
come ober las' night." Most of the
field hands were of this description. But on
each plantation there was usually one man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
noticeably superior to the rest in manner and
language. He was generally the leader in
their religious exercises, and had the gift
of the gab to no small degree; though his
uncontrollable propensity to the use of long
words and incongruous expressions often
gave a ludicrous turn to the effect of his
eloquence.</p>

<p>But whatever their grade of capacity or
intelligence, the negroes agreed in one thing.
They were well satisfied to live on the plantations,
without control of their former owners,
so long as the crops of the present season
would supply them with food. Their liberation
they knew was owing to the success
of the Union troops, and they showed a
much more intelligent comprehension of the
causes and probable results of the war than
they had been supposed to possess. But as
for doing anything themselves to help it on,
that did not appear to form part of their
calculations. They would work for their
rations when destitute, would obey when
commanded as they had been accustomed,
and they would aid the Union cause whenever
they could do so in a passive sort of
way. But we soon found that we must not
look to them for anything like energetic or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
spontaneous action. This seemed a strange
indifference to a contest involving the freedom
or servitude of their race, and no doubt
accounted for much of the aversion afterward
felt by our troops to the project of
transforming some of them into soldiers.</p>

<p>But if we had remembered where the
negroes came from, perhaps we should not
have been so much surprised. Their ancestors
had been brought to this country from
the coast of Africa by slave-traders who had
bought them there. They were slaves already,
when they were taken on board ship.
They had been captured in war, or seized by
native marauders, who took them for the purpose
of reducing them to slavery and selling
them for profit. They were consequently
from the least capable and least enterprising
of the negro tribes in Africa; and their <a name="p70_descendants" id="p70_descendants"></a>descendants
in this country were of the same
grade. If they could not resist being made
slaves by other negroes, how could they be
expected to take part in a war between
whites, even to recover their own freedom?</p>

<p>Of course there were exceptions to this.
In the month of May following, a boat's
crew brought away from Charleston harbor
the barge of the Confederate General Ripley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
and escaped with it to the naval vessels outside;
and not long afterward the negro
pilot, Robert Smalls, and his companions ran
the gauntlet of the forts in the night-time
with the steam-tug <i>Planter</i>, and delivered
her safely to the blockading fleet. But these
were rare instances, and nothing of the kind
happened at Hilton Head.</p>

<p>What the sea-island negroes appeared to
excel in more than anything else was handling
an oar, which they did in a way quite
their own. In their long, narrow "dug-outs,"
hollowed from the trunk of a Georgia
pine, each man pulling his oar in unison
with the rest, they would send the primitive
craft through the water with no little velocity.
In lifting and recovering the oar they
had a peculiar twist of the hand and elbow
that no white man could imitate; and their
strange sounding boat songs seemed to give
every moment a fresh impulse to the stroke.
These songs had no resemblance to the half-humorous,
half-sentimental "plantation melodies"
known to theatre-goers at the north.
They were more like religious rhapsodies in
verse. At least, they had many words and
phrases of a religious character; but mingled
together, in a kind of incoherent chant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
with many others of different significance, or
even none at all. It was not its meaning
that gave value to the song; it was its sound
and cadence. Sometimes the verse would
open with a few words of extempore variation
by the leader, and then the other voices
would strike in with the remaining lines
as usual. Oftener than not, the song was a
fugue, every one of the half dozen boatmen
catching up his part at the right second,
and chiming in all the louder and lustier
for having kept still beforehand. Once in a
while the passenger would be startled at seeing
an oarsman suddenly strike the one in
front of him a smacking blow between the
shoulders, at the same time injecting into
the melody a short improvised yell, by way
of stimulus and encouragement. Altogether,
I have seldom witnessed a more entertaining
performance than one of these semi-barbarous
vocal concerts in a South Carolina
dug-out.</p>

<p>Our brigade camp was in a large cotton-field
lying across the road to the northwest.
At the time of our arrival it was covered
with tall, scraggy bushes, their white balls
still ungathered; and for a night or two we
bivouacked in the deep furrows between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
them. But they were soon removed and the
surface quickly trampled down into a serviceable
parade ground, with the regimental
camps extending along one side. Brigade
headquarters were in advance of the parade
ground, opposite the right of the line. At
one end was the general's tent, fronting
upon an oblong space, enclosed on its two
sides by the tents of the staff officers, orderlies,
and employees. Within the enclosed
space was a single live-oak, under which we
gathered in the evening round a fire, to
smoke our pipes and talk over arrivals, <a name="p73_reconnoissances" id="p73_reconnoissances"></a>reconnoissances,
or projected expeditions.</p>

<p>For some weeks pork and hard-bread
were an important part of our fare. Our
private stores from the <i>Oriental</i> were soon
exhausted, and much of the commissary
supplies on the transport fleet had been
lost or damaged on the voyage down. Foraging
on the plantations did something;
and the general even secured a cow, which
he stabled alongside our camp. But she
was of very unprepossessing appearance.
Her only fodder was dry cornstalks; and
the milk she gave, in the opinion of most,
was worse than none at all. The same verdict
was rendered, after trial, on the native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
beef. The most successful venture of this
kind was a young kid, secured in a day's
tramp, which I butchered and dressed myself,
as being the only one of the staff entitled
to rank as sawbones. After a time supply
ships and sutler schooners reached Port
Royal, and our days of short commons were
over.</p>

<p>But the most gratifying arrival was that
of our horses. They had been shipped with
many others, at the starting of the expedition,
on the steamer <i>Belvidere</i>, which
was among the missing when the fleet reassembled
at Port Royal; and hearing nothing
of her, we had given her up for lost.
In reality she had been very roughly handled
in the gale, and many of the animals cast
loose, trampled on and thrown overboard;
but she had managed to keep afloat and
make her way back to Fortress Monroe.
Here, after some delay, the remainder of
the live stock was reshipped and sent down
to Port Royal on another steamer. Fortunately
our own horses were among the survivors.</p>

<p>The process of getting them on shore was
something of a novelty. The ship could
hardly approach nearer than a quarter of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
mile from the beach; so they had to be
dumped into the sea and make a landing
for themselves. The way it was done
was this. A gangway was opened in the
ship's bulwarks, on the side away from
shore; and a gang-plank with cross cleats
laid over the deck to the opening. The
animal was then placed at one end, prepared
to "walk the plank" like a pirate's prisoner.
As he would never do this of himself if he
knew what was coming, he is half persuaded
into it and half forced. One man starts him
with a little gentle solicitation by the head-stall.
At the same time two strong fellows
clasp hands behind him, just above the hocks,
and as he steps forward they follow him
with increasing pressure toward the gangway;
so that by the time he comes in sight
of the awful void beyond, his motion is too
rapid for effectual resistance and over he
goes with a final splash.</p>

<p>Most horses, on coming to the surface,
after a short <a name="p75_reconnoissance" id="p75_reconnoissance"></a>reconnoissance make straight for
the shore, where they are taken in hand by
men waiting for them. But some lose their
heads and swim away in the wrong direction,
so that they must be followed by boats
and captured or turned back; and a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
will persist in getting upon some marshy
island or mud flat, where they flounder
about until rescued with no little trouble
and difficulty. So we took the precaution,
for our own horses, to have a boat in waiting
alongside the ship, with a long halter
shank attached to the head-stall, by which
they could be guided to a safe landing.
On first coming up from his involuntary
plunge bath, the animal's expression is one
of unbounded astonishment and indignation
at the outrage; but he soon follows willingly
in the boat's wake, and, once on shore,
is quite contented to find himself again in
friendly hands.</p>

<p>Every one in a brigade camp thinks his
own horse the best of the lot. He listens
kindly to the eulogies of his comrades on
their respective mounts, but with full persuasion
that every one of them would exchange
with him if he would allow it. My
own animal was a bay stallion, hardly more
than fifteen hands high and slab-sided as a
ghost; and the deep hollows over his eyeballs
proclaimed that his tenth birthday was
already past. But he had plenty of lightning
in his veins, and there must have been
royal blood in his pedigree, though it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
stolen one. He would go over broken
bridges wherever there were timbers enough
for a foothold; and I have taken him out
on a flatboat to the middle of a wide creek
and then walked him up a gang-plank to the
deck of a steamer without his showing the
least hesitation. Notwithstanding his slender
build, his power of endurance was extreme,
and the oddities of his disposition
were an unending source of surprise and entertainment.</p>

<p>The next enterprise of the expeditionary
corps was the siege of Fort Pulaski, at
the mouth of the Savannah river. It was
a formidable casemated work, situated just
inside the entrance, and guarding the approach
from below to the city of Savannah.
It could not be successfully attacked by the
navy, owing to its size and strength and the
narrow limits of the river channel giving no
room for the evolutions of a fleet. The
only place where land batteries could be
planted against it was Tybee island, between
it and the sea, where there were but
slender facilities for such an operation.
The island was half sand and half marsh.
On its sea-front was a shelving beach, backed
by a low ridge with a few stunted pines and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
bushes; and on the land side there was little
more than a wide stretch of trembling morass,
in full view of the fort and commanded
by its guns. Nevertheless Captain Gillmore
reported that the thing could be done; and
early in December the Forty-sixth regiment
was detached from our brigade and sent to
occupy Tybee island. The city of Savannah
was fifteen miles above the fort, on the
south side of the river.</p>

<p>The part assigned to General Viele was
to establish a blockade of the Savannah
river, between the city and the fort. In the
month of January we struck camp at Hilton
Head and moved southwest to the farther
end of Daufuskie, the last of the islands
in that direction suitable for occupation by
troops. From Hilton Head in direct line it
was only fifteen or sixteen miles; but by the
circuitous water route through Port Royal
harbor, Scull creek, Calibogue sound,
Cooper river, Ramshorn creek, and New
river, it was nearly twice that distance. In
its general features the island was similar to
Hilton Head. Our quarters were on a
slightly elevated point, overlooking the lowlands
and waterways toward the Savannah
river, which was about three miles away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
In that whole interval there was absolutely
nothing to break the uniform level of the
landscape. It was at Daufuskie and thereabout
that we came to know the singular
network of land and water communication
that marks the region. From the knoll in
front of our headquarters you might see,
some distance away, the masts and smokestack
of a gunboat apparently sailing along
through the meadows. Her spars and perhaps
her bulwarks might be visible, with
nothing to be seen around them but a wide
expanse of grass-covered flats. Go where
she was, and you would find her in a creek
hardly wide enough for her to turn in, but
with ample depth of water and straight vertical
sides of black mud, like an enormous
ditch. Passing through one of these creeks
in a row-boat at half tide, with nothing to
be seen on either hand above the brink, and
other channels opening into it every half
mile or so, all looking alike, it would be
the easiest thing in the world to get lost,
and almost impossible to find your way
again without a guide. Steamers of light
draft and not too great length could pass
through most of these channels at the proper
tide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>On one occasion, after going down to
Hilton Head for some business connected
with the medical department, I took passage
at my return on the steamer <i>Winfield Scott</i>,
carrying one of the regiments destined
for Daufuskie. She left Hilton Head at
an early hour, and in the forenoon reached
the sinuous channels northwest of Calibogue
sound. She was rather a large vessel to attempt
the passage, but with due care and a
flood tide the pilot hoped she might get
through. On coming to a bend in the creek
she would run her nose against the opposite
bank, then back a little and try again, turning
slowly meanwhile, edging round by
degrees and rubbing the mud off the banks,
bow and stern, till she was clear of the obstruction
and ready to go ahead again. At
last she came to a turn that looked rather
easier than the rest, but where there was a
narrow spit at the bottom running out from
one side toward the other. In trying to
pass, the vessel grounded on this spit. It
was still flood tide, and with vigorous pushing
she might get over. So at it she went,
with all steam on and her paddles doing
their best. At each new trial she gained a
little, but it was harder work every time;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
and she finally succeeded, at full high water,
in getting exactly half-way over. Fifteen
minutes later there was no chance. She
was stranded, helpless, on the bar, bow and
stern both sinking slowly with the ebb and
weighing her down past hope of deliverance.
In an hour or two her main deck began to
crack open, and it was all the men could do
to get a few horses across the widening
chasm to be landed on the neighboring
flats. Then we all disembarked and made
ourselves as comfortable as possible while
awaiting other means of transportation.
But the <i>Winfield Scott</i> never left that place
till she was taken away piecemeal. She
had weathered the November gale at sea, to
be wrecked on a sunshiny forenoon in Ramshorn
creek.</p>

<p>The troops at Daufuskie were a part of
the old brigade, together with the Sixth Connecticut,
two or three companies of artillery,
and a detachment of the First New York
Engineers. The last were extremely useful,
as much of the work to be done was of
an engineering character. The spot selected
for the first blockading battery was a part
of Jones' island called "Venus Point," on
the north shore of the Savannah river, four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
miles above Fort Pulaski. To reach it
from Daufuskie we had to pass by boats
through New river and Wright river into
Mud river, and thence across the marshy
surface of Jones' island to Venus Point, a
distance altogether of nearly five miles. The
opening from Wright river into Mud river
was an artificial passage called Wall's Cut,
excavated some years before to enable steamers
from Charleston by the inside route to
get into the Savannah river. It had been
obstructed after the battle of Port Royal by
an old hulk placed crosswise and secured by
piles, to prevent the passage of our gunboats.
A company of the New York Engineers,
under Major Beard, opened the passage
again by removing the piles and swinging
the hulk round lengthwise against the bank,
where it now lay, a dismal looking object,
abandoned at last by friend and foe.</p>

<p>Military operations often seem to be going
on very slowly, especially to those at a
distance who are unacquainted with the local
conditions; but the work required for an enterprise
like the investment of Fort Pulaski,
as we soon found, cannot be done in a hurry.
First of all there must be night <a name="p82_reconnoissances" id="p82_reconnoissances"></a>reconnoissances
by capable and well informed officers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
through intricate waterways and over pathless
islands, to learn the position of the enemy,
the obstacles to be encountered, and
the available points for occupation. After
that begins the labor of the troops.
Wharves must be built and roads cleared,
before the barges and steamers can be used
to advantage for transportation. Jones' island,
the intended location of the battery,
was like its neighbors, a marshy flat covered
with reeds and tall grass. Its surface
was so treacherous that a pole or a stick
could be thrust down through its superficial
layer of tangled roots into a fathomless underlying
quagmire of soft mud. Twice a
month, at the spring tides, it was flooded
almost everywhere to the depth of several
inches; and at no time would it bear with
safety a horse, a wagon, or even a loaded
wheelbarrow. For the transportation of
anything weighty over its surface to Venus
Point, it must have an artificial causeway.</p>

<p>Early in February the troops on Daufuskie
were set to work in the pine woods, cutting
down saplings of the proper size, and
carrying them on their shoulders to a newly
built wharf on the west side of the island.
Ten thousand of these poles were thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
brought from the woods to the water front,
there loaded on flatboats and towed round
to the landing place at Jones' island. There
they were laid crosswise on the surface, to
form a corduroy road, about three-quarters
of a mile in length, to Venus Point. Then
sandbags were carried over, to make something
like firm ground for the gun-platforms,
and a dry spot for the magazine. All the
work at this place had to be done in the
night time, as it was in full view of the
rebel steamers passing every few days up
and down the river.</p>

<p>At last all was ready for taking over the
armament of the battery. In the afternoon
I went over the corduroy toward Venus
Point, and at my return about dusk, two of
the guns were starting on the same road. It
looked then as if the officers and men in
charge would have no easy time of it, but
their difficulties turned out much greater
than I supposed. It took all that night and
the next to get the guns over and put them
in place. With the carriage wheels guided
on a double row of planks laid end to end,
taken up in the rear and laid down in front
as the procession moved on, the shifting
tramways were soon covered with the island<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
mud, smooth and slippery as so much mucilage.
When a wheel happened to get over
the edge of its plank, down it would go,
hub deep, in the soft morass; and then the
men must set to work with levers to lift it
out again, themselves immersed up to their
knees in the same material. Many of them
encased their feet and legs in empty sandbags
tied at the knee, for protection against
the all pervading mud. It was an exhausting
labor, sometimes almost disheartening;
but perseverance at last prevailed, and on
the morning of the twelfth the six guns
were all in position.</p>

<p>The next day I paid another visit to the
work at Venus Point to see how it looked.
It could hardly be called a fort. It was
only a place where some platforms had been
laid down and guns mounted, enclosed by
a low parapet, not so much to repel an enemy
as to keep out the tides. Nevertheless
it was named Fort Vulcan, perhaps because
it was better fitted for aggression than for
defense.</p>

<p>While I was there it happened that the
rebel steamer came down on her usual trip
from Savannah to Fort Pulaski, and the battery
opened on her for the first time. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
was an ordinary river steamboat, painted
white; and her name, the <i>Ida</i>, could be
read with a good glass upon her wheelhouse.
She evidently suspected something new at
Venus Point and hugged the farther edge of
the channel. After some shots had been
launched at her, the artillery officer in charge
invited me to try my hand at the game. So
I sighted one of the guns as well as I could
guess at her speed and distance, pulled the
lanyard, and watched the effect of the discharge
with no little interest. It was the
first time I had ever had the opportunity of
firing at a steamboat. As might be expected,
I failed to make a hit. At that distance
she seemed to be moving very slowly,
though she was no doubt making the best
of the time so far as she was able; and
while my thirty pound projectile was traveling
across the river, she was going down
stream fast enough to be quite out of its
way when it got there. Apparently she escaped
all the shots without serious damage,
for she kept on her course toward Fort Pulaski;
but she did not venture to risk it
again, and returned to Savannah by a circuitous
channel farther south.</p>

<p>A week later the passage was more effectually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
closed by a second battery established
on Bird island, opposite Venus Point and
near the south bank of the river. This was
the same kind of low-lying flat with the
other islands in the neighborhood. When
I made a visit to the work some days afterward,
it was at the period of a spring tide,
and nearly everything beyond the parapet
was submerged. I was taken to the tent of
Major Beard, the commanding officer, in a
row-boat. The plank floor of the tent was
just above the water level; but the major
was lying, high and dry, in a bunk of rough
boards, smoking his pipe with an air of
supreme satisfaction. He had been from
the start most active and efficient in the
work of establishing the blockade, and he
now held the advanced position, where it
hardly looked as if he had ground enough
to stand on. He was commissioned as field
officer in the Forty-eighth New York, but
had been detached for some weeks on special
service at Hilton Head and Daufuskie.</p>

<p>During this time we had at brigade headquarters
several officers of the regular army,
whose acquaintance I greatly enjoyed.
Captain Gillmore, chief engineer of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
expedition, then about thirty-seven years of
age, was with us from the first. Cheerful,
hearty, enterprising, and wholly devoted to
his work, he was the moving spirit throughout.
He knew every detail of the engineering
and artillery service, and his knowledge
was exact and thorough. It was his
examination and advice that determined the
plan for the reduction of Fort Pulaski, and
he fixed upon the location of all the batteries
on Tybee island. The river blockade from
Daufuskie was a part of his scheme, and
while there he spared no pains or fatigue to
superintend everything and make sure that
it was done right. After this was completed,
he returned to Tybee island, to push
on the works at that place with the same unremitting
persistency. The capture of the
fort was the occasion of a well deserved advancement
in rank, and before the close of
the war he became major-general of volunteers.</p>

<p>Lieutenant James H. Wilson, topographical
engineer, and Lieutenant Horace Porter,
ordnance officer, were both busy under
Captain Gillmore's direction. Neither mud
and water, nor rain or darkness seemed to
discourage them; and they would come in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
after a night on Jones' island, wet, weary, and
famished, but as lively and talkative as ever.
Wilson was afterward a cavalry general,
and it was a part of his command that captured
Jeff Davis in his flight through Georgia
in 1865, the last brilliant exploit of the
war. Porter also became a general, and
served on the staff of General Grant through
the Petersburg campaign. Both were
transferred to the batteries at Tybee island
after finishing their work on Daufuskie.
General Viele's troops remained, to keep up
the river blockade, and prevent further supplies
reaching Fort Pulaski.</p>

<p>Our own headquarters had been shifted by
this time to a dwelling-house on the extreme
southernmost point of Daufuskie, about a
mile from the regimental camps. It was a
spacious well-built mansion, and from a sort
of open veranda on the roof there was a
wide prospect, including the mouth of the
Savannah river, with Tybee island and Fort
Pulaski on the opposite shore, a little over
three miles away. I sometimes went up
into this crow's nest before sunrise, to watch
the strange effect of the morning mist. At
that hour the landscape for miles around
was often covered by a low-lying bank of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
white cloud, with a few clumps of trees or
small hillocks emerging from it here and
there like so many scattered islands, and
everything looking cool and still, without
a sign of animal life or human habitation.
Afterward, when the warm sunbeams began
to touch the surface of this cloudy sea, the
mists would slowly melt away into vapor,
and I could see the outlines of the roads
and fields and inlets and watercourses coming
out, one after another, like the markings
on a map. On two sides of the house was
a flower-garden with carefully trimmed beds
and walks, that had evidently been a favorite
with the owner. Roses and camellias
were in full bloom there in February and
March, and many other flowering shrubs
followed as the season went on. The cardinal
grosbeak nested among them almost
within reach of the windows, and the brown
thrush and mocking-bird reared their broods
but a short distance away.</p>

<p>There was a similar house toward the
eastern side of the island, which we occupied
for a brigade hospital. After obtaining
the necessary stores and appliances from
Hilton Head, it made a very convenient
and useful establishment. Here we placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
all the sick or disabled men, likely to need
a prolonged treatment; thus relieving the
regimental hospitals of all but their temporary
cases, and giving the chronic invalids a
better chance for convalescence and recovery.</p>

<p>We had a new topic of interest about this
time in the rebel iron-clad steamer <i>Atlanta</i>,
said to be approaching completion at Savannah.
The country had just passed through a
spasm of terror and relief at the unexpected
performances of the <i>Merrimac</i> and <i>Monitor</i>
at Hampton Roads; and after that, every
one had a realizing sense of the devastation
an iron-clad might accomplish in case there
were no <i>Monitor</i> to oppose her. We knew
that such a vessel was getting ready at Savannah;
and for some weeks it appeared
doubtful whether our control of Venus
Point and Bird island might not at any moment
come to a sudden termination. As a
matter of fact, the <i>Atlanta</i> was getting on
very slowly, and it was not until some
weeks after the fall of Fort Pulaski that she
could be put in condition to move. By
that time the monitor <i>Weehawken</i> was in
waiting for her; and on her approaching
and opening fire, disabled and captured her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
in fifteen minutes. Nevertheless she was
the cause of no little foreboding on Daufuskie
during the months of March and
April.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Captain Gillmore was erecting
his batteries on Tybee island along the
western side of the sand ridge, toward the
fort. Every night, under the cover of darkness
and silence, his working parties traversed
a narrow causeway of fascines and
brushwood to the advanced positions, returning
before daybreak to their camps on
shore. As the low parapets and bombproofs
gradually rose above the surface, they
were shielded from view by clumps of
bushes carefully distributed along the front;
and lastly the heavy guns and ammunition
were transported with the same precautions
to their destination. After seven weeks of
this labor, everything was ready. Eleven
batteries, mounting sixteen mortars and
twenty guns, were arranged along a sinuous
line following the edge of the morass.
From the lookout on our house-top all was
in full view, Fort Pulaski on the right and
Tybee island with its concealed batteries on
the left. At that distance nothing was visible
to show the preparations on either side;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
but the first gun would be seen and heard
from our position almost as well as on the
spot.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of April 10th it
began. A mortar at one of the batteries
gave the signal, and the rest chimed in, one
after another, as fast as the gunners could
get their range. By ten o'clock all were in
operation, mortars, columbiads, and rifled
guns throwing their shells at the parapet or
into the interior of the work, or battering
its nearest wall, at the rate of four discharges
per minute. They were answered with
equal activity by the guns of the fort. This
kept up all day long; the volumes of white
smoke rolling out from both sides, and the
reports, mellowed a little by the distance,
following each other across the river in
almost uninterrupted succession till nightfall.
Then the heavy cannonading was suspended;
but every five minutes a shell from
one of the mortar batteries was sent into
the fort, to keep its defenders uneasy and
prevent their repairing the damages of the
day.</p>

<p>From our point of observation we could
not tell what effect had been produced thus
far on the walls or parapets of either side;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
but neither the fire of the fort nor that of
the batteries appeared seriously impaired.
It seemed likely that several days might
pass before a decisive result, and we waited
patiently to see what the morrow would
bring forth. We could not cross directly
to Tybee island without coming under the
guns of the fort, and could only get there by
the circuitous route of Hilton Head, which
would take far too much time, and would
not, after all, give us so good a view of both
sides as we already had. Moreover, a new
mortar battery was to be established that
night, from General Viele's command, on an
island above the fort, to bombard it from the
rear.</p>

<p>Next morning the music of the great
guns began again. Neither side seemed
disabled or disheartened, and the cannonading
went on much as it had done the day before.
But we had our own duties to perform,
and however interesting the spectacle
we could not watch it continuously. Early
in the afternoon I was at a little distance
from the house, when I missed all at once
the sound of the guns. One five minutes
passed by, and then another, but the silence
continued. What did it mean? Were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
batteries silenced, and the game played out
and lost? That was hardly likely, because
then the fort would no doubt become the
attacking party and keep on worrying the
batteries till they could be abandoned at
nightfall. Still this was only a surmise, and
we knew not what reason there might be
against it. Hastily regaining our observatory
on the roof, every available telescope
was leveled at the parapet of the fort, where
a white flag was visible in place of the rebel
ensign. Pulaski had surrendered.</p>

<p>I do not think any one expected the end
so soon. The fire of the fort had been
nearly as vigorous the second day as the
first. Its means of active defense were evidently
far from exhausted; and yet it had
given up the fight, as it were on a sudden,
while still able to hold its own and perhaps
tire out the enemy at last. But there was a
reason for this, which we learned soon afterward
on our visit to the place.</p>

<p>Of course every one was anxious to see
the captured fort. On the following day
General Viele with his staff went on board a
small steamer and started for the trip. This
time we were no longer obliged to take the
crooked route through Wall's Cut and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
around Jones' island, but steamed directly
down into the Savannah river opposite the
fort. As we approached this frowning
stronghold that had so long held us at bay,
its effect was something to be remembered.
Its massive walls covering five or six acres
of ground, and its double row of heavy guns,
seemed well able to repel intruders. For
nearly three months we had looked at it with
a mingled feeling of desire and dread. It
would have been dangerous at any time to
show ourselves within a mile of it; and it
would have been a prison to any who should
venture within a few hundred yards. Now
we could tie up at the steamboat landing,
and walk over the long pathway to its gorge,
unchallenged by any but our own sentries.
Inside, it was a strange sight; the parade
ground was scored with deep trenches to
receive the falling shells, and the interior
walls were fenced with great blindages of
square hewn timbers at an angle of forty-five
degrees. For the garrison had been at
work on their side, almost as hard as the
besiegers. In many places the blindages
were splintered by shot and shell, and the
passage-ways beneath obstructed with the
torn fragments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>The main effect of the cannonading was
to be seen at the southeast angle of the fort.
The outer wall was crumbled and ruined to
such a degree that two of the casemates
were open at the front and their guns half
buried in the fallen débris; and the ditch,
forty-eight feet wide, was partly filled with
a confused heap of shattered masonry.
Here it was that Captain Gillmore had concentrated
the fire of his breaching batteries.
As an army engineer, he was acquainted
with the construction of Fort Pulaski; and
he knew that the powder magazine was located
at its northwest angle. This would
bring it, after the breaching of the opposite
wall, in the direct line of fire; and when the
shells from his rifled guns began to pass
through the opening and strike the defenses
of the magazine, no choice was left to the
garrison but surrender. They found themselves
in momentary danger of explosion,
and wisely lost no time in bringing the contest
to an end.</p>

<p>The siege of Fort Pulaski was a very
different affair from the battle of Port Royal.
One was a naval, the other a military victory.
At Hilton Head the troops could not
have landed anywhere except under the protection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of the navy; and after the reduction
of the forts there was no longer any enemy
to oppose them. At Pulaski the troops
took possession of Tybee island, which the
rebel commander had neglected or thought
it unnecessary to protect, and planted their
batteries on the only ground from which
the fort could be attacked. Some valuable
assistance was rendered by the gunboats
in patrolling the neighboring sounds
and inlets, but the main part of the work
throughout was that of the artillerist and engineer.</p>

<p>I do not know why the enemy failed to
interrupt this work by shelling the narrow
strip of land, more than a mile in length, over
which all the material for the batteries had
to be transported. They must have known
that something of this kind was the sole
purpose for which our forces had occupied
Tybee island; and their elaborate preparations
for defense inside the fort showed that
they were fully aware from what direction
the attack would come. Perhaps after the
fort was invested from above, they wished
to economize their ammunition for the final
struggle. Still one would think that a
few shells expended while the batteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
were in progress would be of more service
than an equal number after their completion.</p>

<p>But perhaps the enemy were not very
well acquainted with Tybee island, and supposed
that our troops could reach the front
by some other route than the one they were
really compelled to follow. Notwithstanding
the proximity of the island, it is possible
that the rebel commander did not know its
important features for military operations.
In General Barnard's Report on the Defences
of Washington in 1861, it appears that at
that time the engineer corps of the regular
army had no accurate surveys of the region
south of the Potomac river opposite the national
capital; so that the proper location
for a number of the defensive works could
not be fixed upon until after our troops
were in possession of the ground. He even
says that many of our engineer officers were
more familiar with the military topography
of the neighborhood of Paris than with that
surrounding the city of Washington. If
the defenders of Fort Pulaski in 1862 were
equally ignorant of Tybee island, it might
account for their apparent inactivity during
the siege operations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Gillmore did not rest satisfied
with the reduction of Fort Pulaski. He
made it the means of further information in
gunnery and military engineering. His records
showed the number of shots fired from
each gun and mortar during the bombardment,
the percentage of those which were
effective or failed to reach the mark, and the
depth of penetration of the different kinds
of projectiles in the walls of the fort; and
he compared the results with those given by
the best military authorities. It was the
first time that rifled cannon had been used
in actual warfare against masonry walls;
and he found that they could do more execution
at longer range and with less weight
of metal, than any of the older forms of
artillery. He showed that, with such guns,
walls of solid brickwork, over seven feet
thick, could be breached at the distance of
nearly one mile; more than twice as far as
it had ever before been thought practicable.
Had it not been for his confident and steady
persistence in this design, it is likely that
the occupation of Tybee island would have
been a useless enterprise.</p>

<p>After the fall of Fort Pulaski the troops
on Daufuskie island were released for other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
duty. General Viele was ordered north,
and became the military governor of Norfolk
on its recapture from the enemy early
in May. Before the end of that month, I
was again at Hilton Head, acting as medical
director for the troops at that point.</p>

<p><i>After Surgeon Dalton's service with the
Seventh Regiment of Infantry of The
National Guard of the State of New York,
he was commissioned by President Lincoln,
August 3, 1861, Brigade Surgeon of Volunteers
(afterwards Surgeon United States
Volunteers); served as Surgeon in Chief to
General Viele's command in South Carolina;
as Medical Inspector of the Department
of the South; and as Chief Medical
officer on Morris Island, South Carolina.</i></p>

<p><i>His health became seriously impaired by
his long continued service in the malarial
regions of the South, so as to incapacitate
him for duty, and he consequently resigned
from the Army, March 5, 1864.</i></p>

<p><i>As soon as his health, never fully restored,
permitted, he resumed his work as Professor
of Physiology at the College of Physicians
and Surgeons of New York; resigned in
1883; was elected President of the College
in 1884, and so continued until his death,
which occurred in New York, February 12,
1889, at the age of sixty-four years and
ten days.</i></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
